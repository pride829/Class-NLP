    "Now, having the concepts of skip-gram and MapReduce in mind, it's time to put these all together: let's generate skip-gram table with MapReduce technique!  \n",

    "It may sound scary to some of you, so let's break it down first.  \n",

    "   a b -3 1\n",

    "   a b -3 1\n",

    "   b d 2  1\n",
    "   c e -2 1\n",

    "3. **Reducer** :  \n",
    "   Since the results have been sorted in the previous step, we can easily calculate the frequency of each skip-gram with different distance.  \n",
